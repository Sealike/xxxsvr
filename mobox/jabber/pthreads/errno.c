 * Re-entrant errno.
 *
 * Each thread has it's own errno variable in pthread_t.
 *
 * The benefit of using the pthread_t structure
 * instead of another TSD key is TSD keys are limited
 * on Win32 to 64 per process. Secondly, to implement
 * it properly without using pthread_t you'd need
 * to dynamically allocate an int on starting the thread
 * and store it manually into TLS and then ensure that you free
 * it on thread termination. We get all that for free
 * by simply storing the errno on the pthread_t structure.
 *
 * MSVC and Mingw32 already have there own thread-safe errno.
